I am a Master's student at **KAIST Kim Jaechul AI Graduate School**, advised by Prof. Sungsoo Ahn. My research focuses on **AI for Science**, specifically aiming to accelerate or approximate **DFT (Density Functional Theory)** and **MD (Molecular Dynamics)** using AI, and solving physical/chemical problems with machine learning.

Previously, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics at **POSTECH**, where I also explored Chemical Engineering.
